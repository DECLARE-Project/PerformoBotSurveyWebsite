                    <p>
                        Thank you for participating in our study and helping us to evaluate PerformoBot! The study
                        consists of two parts and should take around 20 minutes.<br> <br>
                        As soon as you press the <b>Start</b> button below, you will be presented with a task in which
                        you have to evaluate the performance of an exemplary software system with the help of
                        PerformoBot. <br> <br>
                        You have up to <b>eight minutes</b> to complete the task, which should be enough time to
                        complete it without a problem. A timer on the left will show you how much time you have left.
                        <br> <br>
                        The interaction history with PerformoBot will be saved to evaluate the chatbot. For that reason, please do not enter any personal data.<br> <br>
                        After you have completed the task or when the time is up, we will present you a link to a
                        <b>survey</b>. In the survey, we ask you to give us some information about previous experience
                        with chatbots and software performance evaluation that you might have had before participating in the study.
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, we will ask you several questions about your interaction with PerformoBot in order to evaluate the chatbot and improve it in the future. <br> <br>
                        If you want, you can interact with PerformoBot on the start page while you complete the
                        survey.<br> <br>
                        <b>A unique identification number will be generated for you to connect your chatbot interaction with your answers in the survey. This number functions as the start of the chatbot interaction and will be automatically filled out in the survey.</b> <br> <br>
                        Are you ready to start working on the performance evaluation task? Then press the <b>Start</b>
                        button to begin!
                    </p>
